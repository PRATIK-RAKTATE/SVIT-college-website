  HODDesk: `Academic work of First year Engineering is to be planned and monitored by Dean Academic. As per the syllabus prescribed by Savitribai Phule Pune University, First year Engineering students have common curriculum irrespective of specific branches chosen by them.

Dean Academic is the Head of First Year Engineering. He monitors the attendance of students, conduct periodical test, identifies needs and arranges some special lectures if required. Also keeps parent informed about progress of their wards at regular interval. We have started Teacher Guardian Scheme (Mentoring Scheme) from academic year 2002. Under the scheme, a teacher is nominated as Guardian for small group of students and students can seek help from respective teacher in solving their day today problem. The scheme also maintains healthy relation between students and teachers.

We also believe that overall personality development of students can be achieved by giving them opportunities in all possible fields, hence we have started separate Students Association of First Year engineering students (SAFE). Under this association, we conduct expert lectures, seminars, workshops and various competitions.`,
