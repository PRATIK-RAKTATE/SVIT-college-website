  HODDesk: `Dear Students & Viewers,

Welcome to the family of Engineers!

I am delighted to introduce you to the Department of Electronics & Computer Engineering at Pravara’s Sir Visvesvaraya Institute of Technology, Chincholi, Sinnar, Nashik. Our department has a vision to produce competent and innovative engineers in the field of Electronics and Computer Engineering. Our department has excellent and experienced faculty members who cater to the University curriculum. We have well-equipped laboratories with latest software and hardware such as Xilinx, NI Lab View, MATLAB, OCTAVE, IoT Environment, Google Cloud, and Multisim.

Electronics and Computer Engineering is a broad engineering field that covers important subfields such as Analog Electronics, Digital Electronics, Embedded Systems, Power Electronics, and Communication Systems. Electronics-based products play a vital role in our daily lives, from the sophisticated diagnostic equipment used in modern hospitals to leading-edge fiber optic communications. Computer technology, telecommunications and consumer electronics are advancing at an ever-increasing pace.

Apart from academic excellence, our department also encourages students to take part in various co-curricular activities. We have a student association called ASSET (Association of Student Electronics & Computer), under which we organize different events like GD, Quiz, Circuit Design contest, debate, project exhibition, indoor and outdoor games. We also arrange guest lectures/seminars on topics such as Advancement in Technology, Entrepreneurship Development, Competitive Examinations (GATE/GRE/TOFEL), Social Awareness/Responsibilities. We also host various technical events on state/national levels.

Our alumni passed out in past two decades from the equivalent course as Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering and have been successfully placed in various private sectors and public sector organizations. Some of our regular recruiters are TCS, Siemens, KPIT, L&T Infotech, Rishabh Instruments, Mahindra and Mahindra, CGL, PSPL and Bosch. We also motivate our students to become entrepreneurs.

I hope you find this information useful and interesting. I congratulate the creative and sincere efforts taken by my faculty members and students for the achievement of Electronics & Computer Department and I wish all of them a great success in their bright future.`,
