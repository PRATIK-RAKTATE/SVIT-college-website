            Dear Students/Parents/Alumni, It gives me immense pleasure to
            introduce you to Sir Visvesvaraya Institute of Technology (SVIT).
            Technical Education is the backbone of every nation and is the
            stepping stone for a country to move into the niche of a developed
            nation. Sir Visvesvaraya Institute of Technology was established in
            the year 1998-99, close to the pilgrimage city of Nashik, to fulfill
            this national objective. Since inception, SVIT is promoting
            excellence in education with the help of highly qualified faculty
            members and modern infrastructure. It is a matter of pride that SVIT
            continues to be the ‘Institute of Choice’ for students from all over
            India when students today have vast options while selecting
            engineering colleges.
          </p>

          <p>
            To my mind an educational institute is not just about bricks, mortar
            and concrete, but about building character, enriching minds and
            about enriching experiences that last a lifetime. Life is not a set
            of instructions but is a series of experiences and a learning
            process. Engineering is no exception. This is where "SVIT" steps in
            - to make a difference and where learning is not just a series of
            instructions but a passion, which goes beyond books, beyond
            instructions, beyond learning horizons.
          </p>

          <p>
            The institute is also engaged in supporting the students to refine
            the necessary skills, attitudes and the aptitude towards the
            corporate placement process in the campus by the way of periodical
            competitive tests and group interaction exercises. As a part of
            co-curricular and extracurricular activities, we conduct national
            and intercollegiate level seminars and workshops, technical events
            to encourage students to participate in technical paper presentation
            contests, etc.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our ambition is to create a college that meets/exceeds the
            educational, social and physical needs of all its students. One of
            our aims is to provide the opportunity to all of our students to
            develop the knowledge and skills that will enable them to take their
            place in the world of work and higher education. It is possible to
            achieve improvements on the academic and other fronts by united
            efforts of Management, faculty members, staff and students.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our effort is continuously focused towards developing and designing
            an overall curriculum that will sharpen individual’s capacity to
            innovate and inculcate ability to solve problems creatively, besides
            enabling every student to develop skills like critical thinking,
            efficient communication and effective collaboration which are in the
            current context far more important than academic knowledge.
          </p>

          <p>
            We bring the best out of each student as per their talent and
            inculcate ethical and moral values with discipline, making each
            student the best human being with high self-confidence and, of
            course, a responsible citizen of the nation.
          </p>

          <p>
            We wish our stakeholders and well-wishers all the best and good
            luck.
          </p>
